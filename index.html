        <p><img class="profile" src="images\profile\main.jpg">Hi! We are the Lain Taylor Nature Guide (LTNG), 
            an organization that aims to assist in finding and relaying new and interesting national parks and mountains for 
            anybody, even newcomers, to explore and enjoy. We were founded in 2023 by Ana Aikman, also known as Lain Taylor, in tandem with
            marketing expert Emma Taylor, technician Samuel Smith, designer Moroni Wesel, and photographer Kurt Refling.</p>

            who was tapped for LTNG by her partner Lain Taylor not too long after the company was founded. With her
            excellent observation and creativity, Emma is an unfathomably important part of the LTNG team and is very
            dedicated to helping the company market their nature park and mountain range directory, as well as generally
            assisting with directing the company and planning what comes next!</p>

            who founded LTNG after the success of her T-shirt brand, LAIN TAYLOR. She travels when she can afford to,
            and assembled the LTNG team after being inspired to do so by fellow nature guides at Plural Sight Travel, 
            an older organization that aimed to establish a consistent template for nature guide sites across the web.
            She is the leader of the company as well as designer and programmer of the website.</p>
